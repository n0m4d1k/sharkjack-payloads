# Description:	This payload sets the shark jack to DHCP_CLIENT mode to
#               allow access to the internet and then enables SSH on the 
#               shark jack allowing you to SSH into the device an perform updates or download additional tools
#
# Note: As of 07/27/2023 the /etc/opkg/distfeeds.conf file that comes with the stock shark jack is incorrect and will error out.
#       to fix this remove the original text and add the below.

#       Additionally, there is currently nothing in the Hak5 packages repo so this will also throw and error.
#       to fix this you can simply comment out the second line in the /etc/opkg/customfeeds.conf
